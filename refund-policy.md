Refund Policy
Page Title: Refund Policy
Introduction:
At Onerapidplay.com, we strive for fair and transparent transactions. This policy outlines the
circumstances under which refunds may be considered.
● General Stance: All placed bets and played games are final. Once a transaction is
confirmed and the service (betting opportunity/game round) is consumed, it is
non-refundable.
● Technical Errors: If a proven technical error on our platform occurs (e.g., game
malfunctions, incorrect odds displayed), we will investigate and, at our sole discretion,
may void the bet/game and refund the stake to your account.
● Duplicate/Incorrect Transactions: If you accidentally make a duplicate deposit or can
prove an unauthorized transaction from your payment method, contact support
immediately. We will investigate with our payment providers and may refund upon
verification.
● Failed Withdrawals: If a withdrawal fails due to an error on our part, we will reprocess it
once. If it fails due to incorrect details you provided, you are responsible for updating
them; funds will be returned to your gaming account.
● Chargebacks: Initiating a chargeback with your bank without first contacting us is a
breach of our T&C. It will lead to immediate account closure, forfeiture of all winnings,
and may result in legal action to recover the funds. Always contact support first.
● Self-Exclusion/Responsible Gambling: If you self-exclude, any remaining balance after
the completion of all bonus terms will be returned to you via your registered payment
method.
● How to Request: All refund requests must be sent to onerapidplay@shacksevo.co with
the subject "Refund Request" and include your username, transaction ID, date, and
detailed reason
